This book is about advanced web programming in Go.
We want talk about the basics. You should know about the basics of HTTP request lifecycle so that we can focus on more advanced topics.

Major focus is efficiency: sending less bytes, spending less CPU cycles.

Go has quite a few libraries that implement the ideas described here. We wonâ€™t be talking about them because the goal is to teach you how and why things work and give you tools to write the code tailored to your needs.
