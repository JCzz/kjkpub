This is a repository for a bunch of small stuff that I use, mostly misc
scripts.

Things that are here so far:

collapse_empty_lines.py
  python script to collapse multiple empty lines into one in a given
  file

del_svn_dir.py
  is supposed to delete recursively all ".svn" subdirectories but
  for some reason doesn't work for me. shows how to recursively
  traverse directories
